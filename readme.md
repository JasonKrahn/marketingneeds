- wordpress_coder.html is code I copy and paste into wordpress through the [coder](https://wordpress.org/plugins/wp-coder/) plugin.
- The file has less css because the html on the web inherits css from wordpress
- index.html is the local verstion used to preview and experiement.

## Things to do/try

- Firm up the css for responsiveity and mobile. Example images squish in mobile safari
- Build a way so that allopws file / print to print the completed chart with the chart background.
  Right now if you print the chart dissapears and just the plotted points show

## If I get the time

- Edit chart for more clarity in writing
- Find a way to make the chart canvas responsive
